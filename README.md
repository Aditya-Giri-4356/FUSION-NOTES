### The AI-Powered Collaborative Study Suite

FusionNotes is a next-generation, aesthetic Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to synchronize fragmented study materials into unified, AI-synthesized master guides. We built it with a focus on high-end user experience and robust real-time collaboration.

## Innovation

Our Gemini-powered synthesis goes beyond simple OCR. FusionNotes uses Google Gemini (1.5 Pro) to synthesize heterogeneous inputs — handwritten notes, textbook snippets, and flowcharts — into a coherent Master Study Guide. The system also features multi-modal intelligence that automatically detects and renders LaTeX equations and Mermaid.js diagrams from simple image uploads or text snippets. We also designed an aesthetic, high-utility interface inspired by high-end Linux customizations, featuring 16px blur glassmorphism and over-damped spring animations for a snappy, premium feel.

## Technical Implementation

We built a high-performance FastAPI backend designed for low-latency AI processing. For collaboration, we use Supabase (Postgres/RLS) to power instant multi-user synchronization, activity streams, and live profile tracking. FusionNotes is also a fully offline-capable Progressive Web App with service worker caching and cross-device responsiveness. On top of that, we implemented custom OCR logic to handle tables and flowcharts, ensuring parity between raw study data and the final synthesized output.

## Feasibility and Scalability

We leveraged Supabase for infinite horizontal scaling and Google's GenAI for efficient, high-volume data distillation, giving FusionNotes an enterprise-grade backbone. The application directly addresses the problem of fragmented knowledge in student groups, merging separate study habits into a single, high-fidelity knowledge base. We have fully purged the system of mock data, with live user synchronization in place, making it ready for immediate campus deployment.
